        How like a winter hath my absence been<br>
        From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br>
        What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br>
        What old December's bareness everywhere!<br>
        And yet this time removed was summer's time;<br>
        The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br>
        Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br>
        Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br>
        Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br>
        But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;<br>
        For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br>
        And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br>
           Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,<br>
           That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.<br>
